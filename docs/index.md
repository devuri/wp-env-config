  A small package yet powerful package that simplifies the process of defining configuration constants in WordPress.

<p align="center">
  The aim of this package is to simplify the definition of WordPress configuration constants by leveraging PHP dotenv to access environment variables stored in a .env file. By utilizing environment variables in this way, we can enhance the security of our WordPress installation by avoiding the storage of sensitive credentials in our code.
